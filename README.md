# App Store demo project (UI)

This is a demo project I made for a company.  It's built with [Angular 6](https://angular.io/).

## Development server

Make sure [Node.jsÂ® and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are installed.

Then install the Angular CLI globally `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/].

It requires the [API project](https://github.com/shemigon/app-store-demo-api) to run.

Set `apiUrl` variable in `src/environments/environment.ts` to the url of running Api project.
No need to do so if using the default url.
